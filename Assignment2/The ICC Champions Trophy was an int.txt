The ICC Champions Trophy was an international cricket tournament that was part of the International Cricket Council (ICC)'s calendar, designed to bring together the world's top cricketing nations to compete in a prestigious event.
The tournament was first introduced in 1998 under the name ICC KnockOut and was later rebranded as the Champions Trophy in 2002.

The event was initially conceived to provide an opportunity for the best teams to compete in a shorter format, with fewer teams than the ICC Cricket World Cup, making it a highly competitive and elite tournament. The first edition of the ICC KnockOut was held in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and it featured all the top-ranked teams of that time. The tournament format was designed to be a knockout, meaning teams would face elimination after losing a match, adding a layer of excitement and intensity.
Over time, the tournament became a regular feature on the
 international cricketing calendar, being held every 2 to 4 years. 
 
 The tournament typically featured the top 8 ODI teams in the world, based on ICC rankings, which made it a limited yet highly competitive event. The teams that participated in the Champions Trophy were often the powerhouses of world cricket, including Australia, India, South Africa, England, Sri Lanka, New Zealand, Pakistan, and the West Indies, with a few other teams occasionally qualifying based on rankings or special invitations.
The format of the Champions Trophy evolved over the years. Initially,

 it was a single-elimination knockout tournament, but in later editions, it was modified to include a round-robin phase, followed by semifinals and a final. This format allowed teams more opportunities to showcase their skills, but the knockout nature always remained a key element. The 2002 edition, held in India, was particularly memorable as it ended in a joint victory between India and Sri Lanka, after the final was washed out due to rain. This was the first time in the tournament’s history that two teams shared the trophy.
One of the most notable features of the ICC Champions Trophy was its shorter format compared to the World Cup. With only 8 teams participating, the tournament was often held in a compressed timeline, usually lasting around 2 weeks, which allowed for a more intense and action-packed competition. This made it a fan favorite, as it provided a quick, high-stakes cricketing spectacle. The tournament also attracted global attention due to its star-studded teams and the presence of the world’s best players, making it one of the most-watched cricket events.
Throughout its history, the Champions Trophy produced some iconic moments. Australia and India were the most successful teams, with Australia winning the title twice (2006, 2009) and India lifting the trophy twice (2000, 2013). Other winners included South Africa (1998), New Zealand (2000), Sri Lanka (2002), West Indies (2004), and Pakistan (2017). The 2017 final remains one of the most memorable moments in cricket history, as Pakistan pulled off a stunning victory over India, defeating them by 180 runs to claim their first-ever Champions Trophy title.
However, despite its success, the ICC Champions Trophy was discontinued after the 2017 edition, as the ICC decided to focus on promoting the ICC World Test Championship and other global events like the ICC World Cup and ICC T20 World Cup. The decision to end the tournament came as part of a broader shift towards reducing the number of global events and focusing on more meaningful and long-term formats.
In 2021, however, the ICC announced the revival of the Champions Trophy, with the next edition scheduled for 2025 in Pakistan. This decision was met with excitement among cricket fans, as it meant the return of one of the most prestigious tournaments in the sport. The tournament will once again feature the best ODI teams in the world, with high-quality cricket and fierce rivalries taking center stage. The 2025 edition is expected to be a significant event, especially considering that it will be held in Pakistan, a country with a rich cricketing history that has hosted international matches after a long hiatus.
The ICC Champions Trophy's legacy lies in its history of producing thrilling cricket matches, showcasing world-class talent, and providing a platform for nations to prove their dominance in the 50-over format. Its revival in 2025 is anticipated to bring back the excitement, with teams battling for supremacy in one of the most anticipated cricket tournaments on the global stage.
